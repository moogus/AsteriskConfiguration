set the client info in the file  /auth off the root.  this is then pointed to by the sendmail.cf

in the local-host-names add the following:

localhost
asterisktest-VirtualBox

setting up voicemessages do the following:
1) 
create the table in the database to add the voicemessages see MySqlTables and Views for create statement.

2)
add the following lines to the voicemail.conf 
odbcstorage=asterisk(or whatever the connection is cann in the res_odbc)
odbctable=ast_voicemessages(or whatever the table is called in the db)

3)
add the following commands to get up the menu select:
$ cd ~/src/asterisk-complete/asterisk/1.8.<your version>/
$ make menuselect

select the voicemail module and REMOVE ALL STORAGE OPTIONS, why who knows but this works!!!!

4)
rebuilt the install
$ cd ~/src/asterisk-complete/asterisk/1.8.<your version number>/
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

should just work then........fingers crossed.

for ref:
http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+Voicemail+ODBC+storage be aware the dbtable is not accurate use the one in the MySqlTables and Views

rememeber to place the importVmtoDB.pl in the etc/asterisk/ folder  without this you will not be able to record personal voicemail greetings
